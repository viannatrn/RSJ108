Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Choose your focus</h3></h3>
              <p>In the case of either journalistic writng or photojournalism, search for job listings under the National Geographic Society and look into the ones that peak your interest. Be realistic and research the dangers of each job as well. Take note of the requirements for each job and ask yourself how your current experience ties into each of them. It's important to remember that National Geographic values passion and exploration in addition to academic background.</p>

              <p>Whether you want to be a writer, photographer, or explorer, nature expeditions are a great way to get both inspiration and experience. If you want a photography career at National Geographic, get some experience in professional photojournalism in a specialty of your interest. Apply to as many different publications as you can, even if it's just freelance work, in order to build relevant writing experience. You may also send in your story ideas and links to your work to editorial@natgeotraveller.co.uk.</p>

              <h3>Develop your skills to focus on storytelling, research, and conservation.</h3>
              <p>Take your education and interests and channel them into desirable National Geographic skills. Regularly brainstorm new projects. Get in the habit of constantly asking yourself how your unique work and skills can tell an innovative story about the world around you. National Geographic values unique experience more than anything, so don't cater your education to a job in National Geographic—do something you enjoy! As you progress through your degree, ask yourself how your learning can be applied to projects that would be beneficial for National Geographic.</p>

              <h3>Finding National Geographic Jobs</h3>
              <p>Check jobs from National Geographic Partners for various media roles. Whether you're interested in photography or journalism, National Geographic Partners offers jobs in their television and production arm. As mentioned previously, National Geographic Society has a more varied array of job listings. So keep an eye out for jobs that match your experience, education, and skills. For undergraduate and graduate students, National Geographic offers summer internships to gain experience and job-related skills. Look for open positions on their website in January and apply via the online application. It may be useful to know that explorers in the fields of research, education, conservation, and technology are eligible for a grant. National Geographic prefers projects that are not just strictly research work and integrate experiences outside of the laboratory. In addition, it must fit into one of three categories: Wildlife, the Human Journey, or the Changing Planet.</p>

              <h3>Applying for a Job</h3>
              <p>Create your own resume and cover letter. Include all of your relevant employment and educational history in your resume. Be sure to list all of your special skills and qualifications—National Geographic values these highly. When it comes to personal information such as values and the things that drive and motivate you, save them for your cover letter. Create an account on the National Geographic job listing site. Both National Geographic Partners and National Geographic Society operate via the Workday database. The database allows members to apply for National Geographic jobs via their server. To use it, you need to create an account by providing your email and a password. From here, you can upload your resume, cover letter, and experience. Once you have your resume and cover letter, visit the job listing that interests you and submit an application. Due to the competition for National Geographic jobs, expect to wait at least 6 months to hear back for acceptance.</p>
